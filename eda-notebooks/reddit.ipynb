set of people in every class, every term + Opportunities to socialize in clubs as well.\\\\n\\\\nI guess the above can apply for uni as well, but probably a really important difference is that in HS, you wouldn\\'t be sitting all class just listening to a lecture. You would usually have time to do homework/in-class work, where you could talk to others and collaborate, or just chill. Plus more frequent group projects, etc.\", \"top_awarded_type\": null, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"author_patreon_flair\": false, \"collapsed\": false, \"author_flair_richtext\": [],

Do not deviate from the main points.\\\\n\\\\nstep by step process:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Need to find a way to make first contact with her,** she needs to know who you are. You definitely *don\\'t want to ask her on a date here or show interest in her*. My advice would be to find a natural way to go up to her (as if you just stumbled onto her) and say something like \\\\\"Hey.. you look a little familiar have we met before\\\\\" worst case she says something like \\\\\"uh no I don\\'t think so\\\\\" -&gt; here is where you immediately leverage your social circle and say \\\\\"wait do you know someone named X\\\\\". X should be whoever you know that is closest with her. She should open up really quick when you say this. ask her how they know each other. Be playfully amused at her answer and find a way to convey value here then say \\\\\"I gotta run to meet with a friend but I\\'ll see you around\\\\\" . Then smile and leave. \\\\n2. Now she knows who you are and you need to start building a relationship, go up to her naturally one day as if you just ran into her and be like \\\\\"oh hey\\\\\" pause and then ask her a question about the class, have a small conversation. Try your best to make it amusing, make jokes, showcase who you are, take risks. Then 3 minutes in, if the conversation is slowing down even one bit end it the same way as Step 1.   \\\\n3. Do the above a couple times, but do not overdue it and go to Step 3 ASAP. She knows you as that guy who she talks to sometimes, her opinion of whether she wants to have sex with you is already set. So just bite the bullet and say \\\\\"hey what are you doing later today... oh okay cause I wanna get tacos at this place... wanna join me?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis is the advice I would give someone who isn\\'t very experienced. Honestly could write more advice on how to flirt, dealing with shy girls, tips for talking to girls in class, dealing with insecurities you\\'re facing but the comment would be too long and honestly should just learn it yourself as you make mistakes.

Some advice that worked for me was to write notes for content-heavy courses like AP psych or AP bio, and read aloud/teach the content to others without referencing your notes. In terms of calculation/logical courses like math or physics, I prefer to write and redo practice questions before tests, or watching videos online as well (khan academy + the organic chemistry tutor.) As for subjective courses with writing (like english), I tried to get into a class with a relatively easy teacher. But if you aren\\'t so lucky, then Grammarly and peer editing are your best friends. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, if you are targeting canadian schools only, I\\'d advise against taking AP classes (Unless your school offers an AP grade boost) as Waterloo doesn\\'t look at them, and it is more difficult to achieve higher grades. You want to focus on the required courses for your major, and make sure you have some good GPA boosting classes (the easy A classes at your school).\", \"top_awarded_type\": null,

Don't fear having to find the best place to do it. You want to do that with your potential PhD.  It's also good to spread your grad degrees among different Universities for a good breadth of experience. Some also say it makes your CV look better.\\n\\nIf this helps, then I'm glad. If it doesn't apply to the BASc-MASc world then I hope someone else can be of better help. :)   \n","13320                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thanks for the quick reply, it was definitely helpful. \\n\\nI guess I'm not determined enough to take the leap into research.

How much would it cover of your residence + education fees?   \n","14632                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             WEEF is amazing and helps fund many student teams at Waterloo.

It would be like not liking the Conservatives so much that you start you own government and try to get the Queen to recognize you. Wouldn't it be better to just try to change things in the existing system?   \n","16404   You should care about Feds (and in part my candidacy) for three reasons. 1) It affects your student life now, 2) You pay for it, and 3) It'll affect your future life.\\n\\n1. The following are things that you may not of known Feds runs, oversees or manages that *directly affect students' lives*:\\n\\n- [Negotiating](http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/663811--grt-wants-more-money-from-students) the bus pass. \\n- Negotiating your health and dental plan (currently one of the best in Canada)\\n- Insurance provider, resource manager, and service provider to each society (SciSoc, AHSUM, etc)\\n- Oversees and resources over 160 clubs (varying from 10 people to 800 people, cultural, religious, interest-based and more. It's one of the main areas of community on our campus.)\\n- Main advocate to the University. Examples in the last year:\\n 1) pushing for student consultation in regards to O-week changes,  \\n 2) pushing for [teaching chairs](http://www.ousa.ca/2011/12/07/teaching-chairs-a-tangible-step-toward-improving-teaching-quality-on-ontario-campuses-%E2%80%93-by-natalie-cockburn-december-7-2011/) to improve quality of teaching\\n 3) pushing for a weekly Wednesday break from 4:30-6pm to allow for events to occur without class conflicts. \\n- Currently runs O-week\\n- Provide a student voice on issues via Council &amp; Senate\\n- Advocates to the government on behalf of students. As an example many believe the tuition grant ($800) is because of pressure from OUSA (an association of Universities which uWaterloo is a part of) over the past few years.\\n- Run campus wide events. Like Lights concert, Epic Meal Time and Welcome Week.\\n- Run services like GLOW, Student Food Bank, Campus Response Team (amazingly trained first aid people that help at events), Off-campus Dons (1/3 of First Years live off-campus), the International Student Connection and [more](http://feds.ca/clubs-services-and-societies/services-listing) \\n- Runs Bomber, Campus Bubble, Feds Used Book Store, the Fed Bus and more\\n\\nThe idea that Feds only affects 1% of students is pure BS. Whether it's the low cost bus pass, one of the many student clubs, the safest bar night in town, the cost of your tuition or simply the friends you made during O-week - the decisions made by Feds have in some way or another impacted your life whether you know it or not.\\n\\n2) You pay two fees each term. There's an administration fee which covers the Upass and the Health &amp; Dental plan. Plus there's the services fee which covers all the staffing and most of the things listed above.\\n\\nYoue money goes towards this - by voting you get to have your say in where that money can go. There are other opportunities within Feds as well to get your voice heard. We are proposing a text service to allow students to share their uWaterloo problems with us so that we can speak better to student concerns.\\n\\n3) Your future is affected by the success of Waterloo. You may not be thinking about this now, but years from now we'll be applying for jobs and employers opinion of us will be affected by how highly they esteem the University of Waterloo. By working towards a united, safe, innovative and successful University experience we make the University of Waterloo better - and grow its reputation both internally and externally.\\n\\nI hope this helps answer your question better than my old inadequate one.   \n","16549                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Why would I vote for what **other** people want? Religion might not have anything to do with negotiating a bus pass, but if I were an environmentalist, I'd surly vote for the person who is also an environmentalist on the grounds that he wants to keep the bus pass which encourages students to take transit.\\n\\nYou're not comprehending my argument. If I'm black and they're black, it means theres a higher chance my culture may get more funding, or events, or shed in a more positive light. This makes **my** life better.\\n\\nIf I were poor, I would definitely vote for a poorer candidate because they would understand the poor person's plight better. They would have a greater likelihood of removing excessive fees,  or other such activities that would aid a poor person.

The following are things that you may not of known Feds runs, oversees or manages that *directly affect students' lives*:\\n\\n- [Negotiating](http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/663811--grt-wants-more-money-from-students) the bus pass. \\n- Negotiating your health and dental plan (currently one of the best in Canada)\\n- Insurance provider, resource manager, and service provider to each society (SciSoc, AHSUM, etc)\\n- Oversees and resources over 160 clubs (varying from 10 people to 800 people, cultural, religious, interest-based and more. It's one of the main areas of community on our campus.)\\n- Main advocate to the University. Examples in the last year:\\n 1) pushing for student consultation in regards to O-week changes,  \\n 2) pushing for [teaching chairs](http://www.ousa.ca/2011/12/07/teaching-chairs-a-tangible-step-toward-improving-teaching-quality-on-ontario-campuses-%E2%80%93-by-natalie-cockburn-december-7-2011/) to improve quality of teaching\\n 3) pushing for a weekly Wednesday break from 4:30-6pm to allow for events to occur without class conflicts. \\n- Currently runs O-week\\n- Provide a student voice on issues via Council &amp;amp; Senate\\n- Advocates to the government on behalf of students. As an example many believe the tuition grant ($800) is because of pressure from OUSA (an association of Universities which uWaterloo is a part of) over the past few years.\\n- Run campus wide events. Like Lights concert, Epic Meal Time and Welcome Week.\\n- Run services like GLOW, Student Food Bank, Campus Response Team (amazingly trained first aid people that help at events), Off-campus Dons (1/3 of First Years live off-campus), the International Student Connection and [more](http://feds.ca/clubs-services-and-societies/services-listing) \\n- Runs Bomber, Campus Bubble, Feds Used Book Store, the Fed Bus and more\\n\\nThe idea that Feds only affects 1% of students is pure BS. Whether it's the low cost bus pass, one of the many student clubs, the safest bar night in town, the cost of your tuition or simply the friends you made during O-week - the decisions made by Feds have in some way or another impacted your life whether you know it or not.\\n\\n2) You pay two fees each term. There's an administration fee which covers the Upass and the Health &amp;amp; Dental plan. Plus there's the services fee which covers all the staffing and most of the things listed above.\\n\\nYoue money goes towards this - by voting you get to have your say in where that money can go. There are other opportunities within Feds as well to get your voice heard. We are proposing a text service to allow students to share their uWaterloo problems with us so that we can speak better to student concerns.\\n\\n3) Your future is affected by the success of Waterloo. You may not be thinking about this now, but years from now we'll be applying for jobs and employers opinion of us will be affected by how highly they esteem the University of Waterloo. By working towards a united, safe, innovative and successful University experience we make the University of Waterloo better - and grow its reputation both internally and externally.\\n\\nI hope this helps answer your question better than my old inadequate one.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>t3_pmsr4</td>\n","      <td>c3qnxu6</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>16549</th>\n","      <td>2012-02-14 08:30:25</td>\n","      <td>[deleted]</td>\n","      <td>Why would I vote for what **other** people want? Religion might not have anything to do with negotiating a bus pass, but if I were an environmentalist, I'd surly vote for the person who is also an environmentalist on the grounds that he wants to keep the bus pass which encourages students to take transit.\\n\\nYou're not comprehending my argument. If I'm black and they're black, it means theres a higher chance my culture may get more funding, or events, or shed in a more positive light. This makes **my** life better.\\n\\nIf I were poor, I would definitely vote for a poorer candidate because they would understand the poor person's plight better. They would have a greater likelihood of removing excessive fees,  or other such activities that would aid a poor person.

Don't fear having to find the best place to do it. You want to do that with your potential PhD.  It's also good to spread your grad degrees among different Universities for a good breadth of experience. Some also say it makes your CV look better.\\n\\nIf this helps, then I'm glad. If it doesn't apply to the BASc-MASc world then I hope someone else can be of better help. :)   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Thanks for the quick reply, it was definitely helpful. \\n\\nI guess I'm not determined enough to take the leap into research. It's something I can picture myself doing, but I don't know if I will feel the same way after a couple of years. How do you like it so far and do you plan on getting a PhD? \\n\\nA side question: what do you think about taking a year off to do a research internship?

There is a certain joy from discovering/developing new things, highly specializing your knowledge of a set of topics, becoming an expert of sorts.  The challenge I'm having that many people have is that it's not like work or undergrad with a structured schedule.  I started my MSc and basically have 1 due date two years later and have to make sure I stick to that (because your advisor won't... they're 10x busier than you.)\\n\\nI'm not sure I can answer your side question with any sort of accuracy.  I strongly recommend you talk to your undergrad advisor. Their job (and joy) is to chat with you about your options and give you an informed opinion.

My opinion is ill-informed when it comes to research internships.</td>\n","      <td>Mackinstyle</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2147876</th>\n","      <td>2022-12-31 17:43:32</td>\n","      <td>[suggest, plan, ece, masc, part, time]</td>\n","      <td>Suggest a plan for ECE MASc part time</td>\n","      <td>menexploitmen</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>4017</td>\n","      <td>573</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2147877</th>\n","      <td>2022-12-31 17:49:50</td>\n","      <td>[math, finance, pmath, courses]</td>\n","      <td>Math Finance PMATH Courses</td>\n","      <td>QUITIG</td>\n","      <td>14</td>\n","      <td>4017</td>\n","      <td>573</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2147878</th>\n","      <td>2022-12-31 17:53:49</td>\n","      <td>[coop, earnings, based, 1a, grades]</td>\n","      <td>Co-op earnings based on 1A grades</td>\n","      <td>Awkward-Thanks5374</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>4017</td>\n","      <td>573</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2147879</th>\n","      <td>2022-12-31 18:57:34</td>\n","      <td>[non, degree, term]</td>\n","      <td>Non degree term</td>\n","      <td>Living-Midnight-961</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>4017</td>\n","      <td>573</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2147880</th>\n","      <td>2022-12-31 21:41:36</td>\n","      <td>[wholesome, things, uwaterloo, year]</td>\n","      <td>Wholesome things about UWaterloo this year.</td>\n","      <td>TheKoalaFromMars</td>\n","      <td>703</td>\n","      <td>4017</td>\n","      <td>573</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>2147881 rows × 7 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-33752490-504b-450a-a52a-ef6812d813ca')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-33752490-504b-450a-a52a-ef6812d813ca button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

discouraging him from considering it as well, what do you think of it?\\n\\nI'm really sold on St. Paul's, and I really like it already! When asked to pick residences, I have to rank from a choice of The Waterloo facilities (all of them), St. Paul's, Rension and St. Jerome's. Does this mean that if I rank the Waterloo facilities above, say, St.Paul's, does this mean that ALL the Waterloo facilities will be above St. Paul's, or just the ones I pick? Thanks!\\n\\nAs you said, meals are okay, but I've heard that usually the university college's have considerably better food than UW, is this true? And where does St. Paul stand in this pecking order? \\n\\nI like the room setup for two people, it's really unique and apparently good storage space too! \\n   \n","37673                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                OP is officially a faggot.\\n\\nYou have no chance buddy.\\n\\n   \n","37674                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am Korean and I do remember being approached by a random person from the UWKSA to join the club in front of SLC 6 years ago (of course, they spoke to me in Korean).

There is no diversity of opinion or thought allowed in your \"multicultural\" state.\\n\\n&amp;gt; So, according to you, to have a supremacist ideology is actually healthy, since it infers that you don't hate yourself\\n\\nNope. I'll say it **AGAIN: I AM NOT A WHITE SUPREMACIST**. Got it yet?\\n\\nLoving your people, and your culture; being thankful to your ancestors for building wealth and abundance for you; and continuing to create a better life for your children while maintaining your culture, religion and heritage for them to thrive **is not white supremacy**. \\n\\n&amp;gt; Does this mean you would not allow health for other races? Since, presumably, not all races would be able to be supremacist.\\n\\nI want all races to be healthy and happy, yes. Which does not happen when they live as minorities in other nations, when they lose their culture and identity, and adopt some vague utilitarian \"Canadian values\" which essentially create zero cultural cohesion and only lead to segregation.\\n\\n&amp;gt; have you not read history?\\n\\nComing from someone who thinks black slaves invented a bunch of important things I use in my daily life... If they were so innovative and intelligent while slaves, why have they invented literally nothing of importance since then?

I had done a degree in mathematical physics. \\n\\nBy far the best physics teacher at that university is Richard Epp in my opinion. He was an excellent teacher and able to explain even the most difficult concepts to anyone using their own communication style.\\n\\nThe reason I’m posting this is because I truly miss his lectures, I still have his notes but I’m wondering if he did video lectures this past year since covid started, and if they are public access by any chance. \\n\\nI would kill to see one of his lectures again. When I was his student I actually asked him if he would ever record them, but if I recall correctly he didn’t like the idea of deterring students from coming to class.   \n","141580   More restrictions coming in. **Effective Sunday at Midnight (Monday at 00:00)**\\n\\nSome **key**  (read the [link](https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-response-framework-keeping-ontario-safe-and-open#red) for all the restrictions) details on restrictions:\\n\\n**General**\\n\\n* Gathering limit for all organized public events and social gatherings:\\n   * ~~10 people indoors~~  **NOW 5 PEOPLE INDOORS**\\n   * 25 people outdoors\\n* Religious services, weddings and funerals:\\n   * 30% capacity indoors\\n   * 100 people outdoors\\n\\n**Restaurants:**\\n\\n* Maximum number of patrons permitted to be seated indoors is 10\\n* Require patrons to be seated; 2 metre minimum between tables\\n* Outdoor dining, take out, drive through, and delivery permitted\\n* 4 Person Max per table\\n\\n**Sports and recreational fitness facilities:**\\n\\n* Maximum 50 people per facility (revoke OCMOH approved plan) in all combined recreational fitness spaces or programs (not pools, rinks at arenas, community centres, and multi-purpose facilities)\\n* Gyms and fitness studios permitted to be open with:\\n   * 10 people indoors (classes)\\n   * 25 people outdoors (classes)\\n   * 10 people indoors (areas with weights or exercise equipment)\\n* All sports and recreational programs in other facilities (arenas and multiplexes) limited to 10 people per room indoors and 25 outdoors\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSource: [https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-response-framework-keeping-ontario-safe-and-open#red](https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-response-framework-keeping-ontario-safe-and-open#red)\\n\\nSource for red zone move: Doug reading off teleprompter\\n\\n[https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-expected-to-announce-new-restrictions-for-toronto-peel-region-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-1.5197410](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-expected-to-announce-new-restrictions-for-toronto-peel-region-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-1.5197410)   \n","141583                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Hi all!

Late night 12:45 AM. I saw someone overdrunk walking on sidewalk like a drunkard. Going sideways into the road. It was extremely scary to saw vehicles passing by almost. I quickly ran to her and able to pull her onto the sidewalk. Tried to ask whereabouts address but she's not able to respond. It is freaking -30 ish outside. She didn't had gloves and the most difficult thing is that her coat is fully unbuttoned and whatever she's wearing inside made her half naked. (I was shit scared to even cover her properly..) adding to this she's trying to remove the coat !!. I called 911 quickly and asked to come ASAP to Columbia/ Albert. I tried to walk her to nearby indoors but covering her properly was extremely difficult. The 911 responded back that they're busy and told me that police is on the way. I tried to stop a car, some SUV and the family was kind enough to keep her inside. Then the 911 called me again to confirm the location and lot of details like what car, my details etc. It took nearly 10 mins for the police to show up. and she was finally taken care. \\n\\nI just couldn't imagine, how she'll be if I wasn't there at that time.  Let alone her safety the weather itself would've been fatal to her. \\n\\nDO NOT END UP IN THOSE SITUATIONS\\n\\nIf you think you're drunk/ you see someone drunk\\nkeep him/her indoors. or have someone to help.\\n\\nDon't leave them on their own.\\n\\n\\n\\n|None |{}         |self.uwaterloo                |None         |2018-01-01 07:09:54|uwaterloo|t5_2rb5s    |self     |Be careful when you're drunk (especially girls)                             |MASc Mech            |null                  |saiprnth87          |False   |{}                |None        |0     |[be, careful, when, youre, drunk, especially, girls]                                       |[careful, youre, drunk, especially, girls]               |(262144,[45134,140261,209749,224909,226953],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0])                             |(262144,[45134,140261,209749,224909,226953],[7.114132978630328,7.4770384723196965,5.624654381275207,8.303717045504165,5.119728479636404])                                                                       |(262144,[45134,140261,209749,224909,226953],[0.46574556260395816,0.48950413217781,0.3682329002183198,0.5436248350543207,0.3351765883896714])                                                                          |\n","|0                    |https://i.redd.it/hitq7mwlhg701.jpg                                                                                                                     |False       |11          |False  |Art            |/r/uwaterloo/comments/7nf30n/2018_dawns_on_waterloo/                           |art                 |202  |False  |7nf30n|null                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |None |{}         |i.redd.it                     |None         |2018-01-01 13:14:21|uwaterloo|t5_2rb5s    |image    |2018 dawns on Waterloo                                                      |CS                   |null                  |newwworld           |False   |{}                |None        |0     |[2018, dawns, on, waterloo]                                                                |[2018, dawns, waterloo]                                  |(262144,[29997,30066,159586],[1.0,1.0,1.0])                                                    |(262144,[29997,30066,159586],[3.349904087274605,9.556480013999533,4.68894556354395])                                                                                                                            |(262144,[29997,30066,159586],[0.30018414109097186,0.8563539940599885,0.42017534232148934])                                                                                                                            |\n","|0                    |https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/7nf3dk/mental_health_monday/                                                                                |False       |8           |False  |Serious        |/r/uwaterloo/comments/7nf3dk/mental_health_monday/                             |serious             |5    |True   |7nf3dk|Welcome to Mental Health Monday.

Which university would I get my diploma from? Both? (Just making sure)\\n\\nSecond question, is it harder to get in the program when applying through waterloo than laurier? How competitive is the dual degree program through waterloo? How competitive is it for laurier? On the waterloo website, it recommends I apply through waterloo and laurier. Which leads to my third question...\\n\\nThird question, is it worth applying through laurier if I want to do strictly comp sci? Every other uni/program I am applying to is all comp sci so I'm kind of lost, because I feel like I am going 'off course' and against my original plans.\\n\\nLastly, do I get to do co op through waterloo if I apply through laurier?\\n\\nThanks!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |Klept2              |\n","|GER 272                                                                                                                                                                                 |9         |2    |2           |Has anyone taken GER 272 online?\\nIs it birdy?

It's super frustrating not have any clue what to do and I really want to improve (for future courses/job opportunities/etc).\\n\\nI just wanted to ask if anyone has any advice on how I can become better at ARM/Embedded C/OS programming? I hate how I always have to rely on my partner and I want to become better but I don't know how I can go about improving and understanding whats going on. I literally have 0 clue how others know (literally seems like the entire class knows what they are doing) so well on what code to write for the labs (Do they have previous experience or are they just programming gods). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |stupidprogrammer1   |\n","|Technical question regarding math faculty                                                                                                                                               |9         |0    |2           |How long it takes to get notified on being withdrawn from the math faculty?

So I'm conflicted as I don't have a strong interest in these areas of finance or the course work we've done in these areas for that matter. \\n\\nMy passion? economic and environmental development. Seeing the position of the world and its effect on wildlife, the habitats of different species (i.e. coral reef being killed off, trash build up in the oceans and beaches, resource outsourcing in forests) I'd like to do work that could leave an impact in the world.\\n\\nMy issue? I have no educational background in envrionmental studies and it's gonna take extra schooling if i'd like to specialize in economic/environmental development which also means having to pursue a masters degree some where that economics is reputable. At my rate of math grades, I don't know if i'll be able to get in though..\\n\\nBack to my main question. Passion vs money? moving to my passion would make it harder to find a paying job in this field (unless i was lucky to get an environmental consulting job at an accounting firm, for example), and i feel my double degree would be useless. on the other hand, pursing a career in quant finance or just analytical work could get me to front office work if i stick with it....what do you think?|GeneralTsoChikn     |\n","|Question to Anybody enrolled in CS489 Neural Networks                                                                                                                                   |9         |3    |2           |[deleted]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |[deleted]           |\n","|Regarding the CCC                                                                                                                                                                       |9         |2    |8           |What languages are actually possible to get a perfect score on it?

I fill their requirements (although they are very vague) but they're listed for seniors and their info session isn't until after the application deadline.

Am I eligible to work for 40 hours a week? \\n\\nWhat other on-campus resources can I refer to/access?
